**Abstract:** This paper presents GOAT, a software tool that has been developed to study the effect of different Medium Access Control (MAC) and routing protocols on the energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). GOAT is a graphical network analysis tool that allows designing WSNs, calculating the energy consumption and overall lifetime in thoroughly configurable WSN scenarios. The aim of the GOAT tool is to obtain a knowledge of the behaviour of WSNs in terms of nodes connectivity and energy consumption prior to the WSN deployment in a real environment.
