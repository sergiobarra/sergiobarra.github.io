**Abstract:** MEC Sandbox is an excellent tool that simulates wireless networks and deploys ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) APIs on top of the simulated wireless network. In this demo, we consume these APIs using a decision engine (DE) to scale a video-on-demand (VoD) application located on the network edge.Specifically, the developed DE uses the ETSI MEC Location API and retrieves the number of users in a given zone. The DE then takes actions at the microservice scaling level and executes them through a custom-made Kubernetes-based OpenAPI.
