**Abstract:** The advancements in virtualization technologies and distributed computing infrastructures have sparked the development of cloud-native applications. This is grounded in the breakdown of a monolithic application into smaller, loosely connected components, often referred to as microservices, enabling enhancements in the application’s performance, flexibility, and resilience, along with better resource utilization. When optimizing the performance of cloud-native applications, specific demands arise in terms of application latency and communication delays between microservices that are not taken into consideration by generic orchestration algorithms. In this work, we propose mechanisms for automating the allocation of computing resources to optimize the service delivery of cloud-native applications over the edge-cloud continuum. We initially introduce the problem’s Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP …
