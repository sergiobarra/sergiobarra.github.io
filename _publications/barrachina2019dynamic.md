**Abstract:** In this paper, we discuss the effects on throughput and fairness of dynamic channel bonding (DCB) in spatially distributed high-density wireless local area networks (WLANs). First, we present an analytical framework based on continuous-time Markov networks (CTMNs) for depicting the behavior of different DCB policies in spatially distributed scenarios, where nodes are not required to be within the carrier sense range of each other. Then, we assess the performance of DCB in high-density IEEE 802.11ac/ax WLANs by means of simulations. We show that there may be critical interrelations among nodes in the spatial domain-even if they are located outside the carrier sense range of each other-in a chain reaction manner. Results also reveal that, while always selecting the widest available channel normally maximizes the individual long-term throughput, it often generates unfair situations where other WLANs starve. Moreover, we show that there are scenarios where DCB with stochastic channel width selection improves the latter approach both in terms of individual throughput and fairness. It follows that there is not a unique optimal DCB policy for every case. Instead, smarter bandwidth adaptation is required in the challenging scenarios of next-generation WLANs.
