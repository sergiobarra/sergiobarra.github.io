**Abstract:** The exploitation of novel networking paradigms to manage next-generation mobile networks is essential to meet the requirements of emerging use cases and scenarios. In this demonstration, we showcase a comprehensive end-to-end cloud-native open-source deployment of a 5G mobile network incorporating O-RAN functionality. Spanning across distributed points of presence, this demonstration features a disaggregated and sequential deployment of mobile entities, enabling seamless adaptation to the availability and distribution of computational resources. We highlight the on-demand plug-and-play of different monitoring xApp instances to show the flexibility of the deployment process as a critical enabler towards more autonomous orchestration procedures aimed at optimizing network performance.
