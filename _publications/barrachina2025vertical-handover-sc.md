**Abstract:** The European Governmental Satellite Communications (EU GOVSATCOM) program aims to federate European satellite operators and integrate their systems with 5G terrestrial networks to improve mission-critical services. This paper investigates the Vertical Handover (VHO) between Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial-Networks (NTN) and proposes a scheme suitable for the experimentation of the trial phase of the 5G-GOVSATCOM project. A suitable model has been identified for analyzing the VHO scheme, taking into account the effect of shadowing correlation. Suitable SINR-based VHO triggering conditions have been identified. The VHO performance has been evaluated using key performance indicators (i.e., VHO failure rate and VHO ping-pong rate), identifying the settings that meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.
