**Abstract:** Effective and real-time management of data planes becomes of paramount importance to support the ever-increasing challenging use cases and scenarios foreseen in 5G and beyond. In this demonstration, we present a comprehensive showcase of a cloud-native open-source 5G core deployment, realised as a disaggregated non-public network (NPN) spanning multiple locations. Ranging from cloud to edge points of presence, the demonstration establishes an end-to-end experimental platform with over-the-air transmission capabilities, specifically highlighting the on-demand creation and deletion of User-Plane Functions (UPFs). This dynamic deployment approach harnesses the advantages offered by edge locations, empowering the mobile network to adapt and scale as per its specific requirements. Furthermore, our demo elucidates how to use Open Source MANO (OSM) for easing the management …
