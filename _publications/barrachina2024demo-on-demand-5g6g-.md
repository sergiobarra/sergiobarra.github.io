**Abstract:** Integrating edge computing with 5G/6G, bolstered by standards such as ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), becomes indispensable, particularly in addressing end-to-end latency-sensitive vertical applications. Thus, it is imperative to delve into infrastructure and network considerations, including the relocation of server workloads and optimization of user data planes. Notably, 3GPP facilitates third-party vertical providers’ access to user equipment (UE) metrics and data plane capacities through the Network Exposure Function (NEF). This paper showcases a demonstration that focuses on the seamless coordination of cloud-native workload relocation and user plane function (UPF) selection within the 5G network. Here, the interaction between a vertical provider and the 5G core enables informed decisions aimed at ensuring minimal latency by triggering UPF selection and relocation of containerized servers to …
