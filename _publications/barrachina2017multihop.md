**Abstract:** Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have arisen as a promising communication technology for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) services due to their low power operation, wide coverage range, low cost and scalability. However, most LPWAN solutions like SIGFOX™or LoRaWAN™rely on star topology networks, where stations (STAs) transmit directly to the gateway (GW), which often leads to rapid battery depletion in STAs located far from it. In this work, we analyze the impact on LPWANs energy consumption of multi-hop communication in the uplink, allowing STAs to transmit data packets in lower power levels and higher data rates to closer parent STAs, reducing their energy consumption consequently. To that aim, we introduce the Distance-Ring Exponential Stations Generator (DRESG) framework,1 designed to evaluate the performance of the so-called optimal-hop routing model, which establishes optimal routing connections in terms of energy efficiency, aiming to balance the consumption among all the STAs in the network. Results show that enabling such multi-hop connections entails higher network lifetimes, reducing significantly the bottleneck consumption in LPWANs with up to thousands of STAs. These results lead to foresee multi-hop communication in the uplink as a promising routing alternative for extending the lifetime of LPWAN deployments.
