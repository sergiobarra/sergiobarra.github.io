**Abstract:** This paper introduces the concept of the project 5G-GOVSATCOM funded by the European Union. 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G-NTN) will soon be able to handle all types of applications and provide service to a massive number of users. In this complex and dynamic network ecosystem, end-to-end adaptation of 5G-NTN to meet the specific requirements and use cases of EU-GOVSATCOM humanitarian services is crucial for the efficient deployment of European governmental satellite services. To enable such a vision, the 5GGOVSATCOM project targets the development and evaluation in a natural user environment of different key enabling technologies that aim to provide full integration of 5G-NTN (and terrestrial networks) in the EU-GOVSATCOM framework. All project developments are planned to be first validated in a controlled lab with satellite (and terrestrial) connectivity and, subsequently, to be …
