**Abstract:** Hierarchical, distributed, scalable and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based management of a massive number of network slices in different domains with the goal of zero-touch management is a major challenge for 6G networks. In this paper, we first propose a new vision for distributed network management and orchestration based on existing standardization architectures. This vision aims to embed AI/Machine Learning (ML) into the AI/ML architectures of Standardization Development Organizations (SDOs) such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Our second contribution is a numerical comparison of the benefits of the proposed distributed management and orchestration approach in terms of energy savings through Federated Learning (FL). The experimental topology includes a …
