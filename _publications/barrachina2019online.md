**Abstract:** In order to dynamically adapt the transmission bandwidth in wireless local area networks (WLANs), dynamic channel bonding (DCB) was introduced in IEEE 802.11n. It has been extended since then, and it is expected to be a key element in IEEE 802.11ax and future amendments such as IEEE 802.11be. While DCB is proven to be a compelling mechanism by itself, its performance is deeply tied to the primary channel selection, especially in high-density (HD) deployments, where multiple nodes contend for the spectrum. Traditionally, this primary channel selection relied on picking the most free one without any further consideration. In this letter, in contrast, we propose dynamic-wise (DyWi), a light-weight, decentralized, online primary channel selection algorithm for DCB that improves the expected WLAN throughput by considering not only the occupancy of the target primary channel but also the activity of the secondary channels. Even when assuming important delays due to primary channel switching, simulation results show a significant improvement both in terms of average delay and throughput.
