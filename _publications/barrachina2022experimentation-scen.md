**Abstract:** 5G changes the landscape of mobile networks profoundly, with an evolved architecture supporting unprecedented capacity, spectral efficiency, and increased flexibility. The MARSAL project targets the development and evaluation of a complete framework for the management and orchestration of network resources in 5G and beyond by utilizing a converged optical-wireless network infrastructure in the access and fronthaul/midhaul segments. In this paper, we present a conceptual view of the MARSAL architecture, as well as a wide range of experimentation scenarios.
