**Abstract:** The need of mobile network operators for cost-effectiveness is driving 5G and beyond networks towards highly flexible and agile deployments to adapt to dynamic and resource-constrained scenarios while meeting a myriad of user network stakeholders' requirements. In this setting, we consider that zero-touch orchestration schemes based on cloud-native deployments equipped with end-to-end monitoring capabilities provide the necessary technology mix to be a solution candidate. This demonstration, built on top of an end-to-end cloud-native 5G experimental platform with over- the-air transmissions, shows how dynamic orchestration can relocate container-based end-user applications to fulfil intent-based requirements. Accordingly, we provide an experimental validation to showcase how the platform enables the desired flexible and agile 5G deployments.
