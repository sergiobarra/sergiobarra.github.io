**Abstract:** Novel networking paradigms based on cloudification and open interfaces are making mobile networks more agile to adapt and meet the requirements of emerging use cases. Based on an automated end-to-end cloud-native open-source deployment of a 5G mobile network with over-the-air capabilities, this demonstration features the inclusion of a cloud-native monitoring system to follow the radio access network (RAN) performance evolution. By just defining the number of gNBs, this monitoring system automatically configures independent data sources and dashboards representing the evolution of received information while such gNBs are progressively created on-demand in a distributed environment.
