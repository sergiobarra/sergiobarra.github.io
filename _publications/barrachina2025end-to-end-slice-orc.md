**Abstract:** The adoption of novel network paradigms in the architecture and management of mobile networks is accelerating its evolution. In this demonstration, we contribute to the cloud-native mobile network orchestration domain by presenting an end-to-end system allowing the disaggregated and distributed deployment of mobile network entities from core to RAN based on open-source software. The distinguishing features of this system are the possibility of enabling the configuration of slices that can be later activated on-demand and the use of O-RAN Split 7.2 for over-the-air transmission using commercial equipment.
