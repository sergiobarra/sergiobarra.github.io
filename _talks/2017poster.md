**Abstract:** The number of devices accessing the Internet through Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) is increasing drastically. WLANs are managed by different operators, leading to chaotic wireless spectrum occupancy. By means of transmitting in wider channels through dynamic spectrum access, higher short-term throughputs are achieved. However, the contention among nodes leads to undesirable low performance, which is critical in high-density scenarios like football stadiums and apartment buildings. We propose a learning-based channel selection policy for optimizing WLANs throughput.
