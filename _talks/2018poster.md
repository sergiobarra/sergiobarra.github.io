**Abstract:** We present novel insights on the effects of dynamic channel bonding (DCB) policies in WLANs. We depict the complex interactions that are given in spatially distributed scenarios through Continuous Time Markov Networks (CTMNs). Then, we assess the performance of such policies in high density (HD) IEEE 802.11ax scenarios by means of simulations. We show that always picking the widest channels available can be suboptimal in terms of individual throughput and fairness. Thus, more flexible policies like stochastic width selection are required. Besides, we show that policy learning and/or adaptation is required on a per WLAN basis.
