Short Bio
======
Sergio Barrachina-Muñoz (Barcelona, 1991) holds a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (2021) by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, he received his BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2016), also from UPF. Sergio joined the Wireless Networking Research Group as an intern in 2015, where he worked under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. He was also a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. His thesis research focused on developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation Wi-Fi networks through efficient spectrum access.

Sergio is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Smartech department at Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC) in the context of the 5GMed5GMediaHUB project, which aims to help EU to achieve the goal of becoming a world leader in 5G. Apart from research, Sergio has been involved in teaching undergraduate courses since 2015, with subjects mainly related to computer networks both in UPF and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC).
