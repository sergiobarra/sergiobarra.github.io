Short Bio
======
I hold a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (2021) by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I received my BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2016), also from UPF. I joined the Wireless Networking Research Group as an intern in 2015, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. I was a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. My research mainly focuses on developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation Wi-Fi networks through efficient spectrum access.
