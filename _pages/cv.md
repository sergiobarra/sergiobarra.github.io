Bio
======
Sergio Barrachina-Muñoz (Barcelona, 1991) holds a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (2021) by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, he received his BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2016), also from UPF. Sergio joined the Wireless Networking Research Group at UPF as an intern in 2015, where he worked under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta in the context of ENTOMATIC, a European project devoted to the development of an IoT wireless network to monitor and execute anti-plague methods. During the PhD, Sergio made a 4-months research stay at the Rice Networks research group in Rice University (HOU, USA), where he developed the Wi-Fi All Channel Analyzer (WACA) platform with Prof. Edward Knightly. Such a platform was later used to create a dataset with unique measurement campaigns like a sold-out game in Futbol Club Barcelonas stadium. Besides, Sergio has been a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. As for his thesis, his work focused on developing autonomous machine learning techniques for improving next-generation Wi-Fi networks through efficient spectrum access.

Apart from his thesis work, Sergio also contributed to other areas during the PhD including wireless sensor networks, spatial reuse, and software-defined networking (SDN). Sergio is also one of the creators of Komondor, an open-source IEEE 802.11ax network simulator. The outcomes of his research to the date are 11 journal papers and 8 conference papers, with one runner-up best paper award. Apart from research, Sergio has been involved in teaching undergraduate courses since 2015, with subjects mainly related to computer networks both in UPF and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC).

After successfully defending the PhD with cum laude mention, Sergio worked for 3 months in the Wi-Fi industry as a quality assurance expert for Orange in Barcelona, where his duties dealt with designing and executing test plans for validating the performance of customer premises equipment (CPE) devices. Then, Sergio joined the Smartech department at Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC) as a researcher in March 2021. His work there focuses on contributing to 5G/6G-related topics like network function virtualization (NFV) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) in the context of MARSAL, a project that targets the development of novel cell-free based solutions empowered with an elastic virtual infrastructure. In addition, Sergio contributes to the PARADIGM testbed, where multiple European projects besides MARSAL are being evaluated, including MonB5G, 5GSOLUTIONS, and 5G-MediaHUB.

Sergio's research interests include a wide range of topics related to wireless networking, both theoretical and practical (or testbed-related), including 5G/6G networks, reinforcement learning, federated learning, NFV, MEC, and network slicing orchestration.
