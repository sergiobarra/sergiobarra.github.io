Short Bio
======
PhD candidate in the Department of Information and Communication Technologies at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. I received my BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems in 2015 and 2016, respectively, both from Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I joined the Wireless Networking Research Group in 2015, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. I am a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. My main research interests are developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation wireless networks through efficient spectrum access.
