I hold a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (2021) by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I received my BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2016), also from UPF. I joined the Wireless Networking Research Group as an intern in 2015, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. I was a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. My research mainly focuses on developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation Wi-Fi networks through efficient spectrum access.

I love solving complex (and simple!) problems and I do so by mixing my analytical skills and my inner curiosity to explore and approach problems in different ways. I have large experience in collecting and managing vast datasets and working with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, and Matlab. Apart from a solid background in statistics, I am passionate about machine learning and have widely used it throughout the MSc and PhD. Also, I am pretty confident in communicating with specialized and general audiences.

Apart from playing with numbers, I love literature, guitar, and chess. Indeed, my future adventures target reading more, practicing flamenco styles, and learning the classical chess openings in deep.
