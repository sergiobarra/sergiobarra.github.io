PhD candidate in the Department of Information and Communication Technologies at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. I received my BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems in 2015 and 2016, respectively, both from Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I joined the Wireless Networking Research Group in 2015, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. I am a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. My research mainly focuses on developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation wireless networks through efficient spectrum access.

I love solving complex (and simple!) problems and I do so by mixing my analytical skills and my inner curiosity to explore and approach problems in different ways. I have large experience in collecting and managing large datasets and working with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, and Matlab. Apart from a solid background in statistics, I am passionate about machine learning and have widely used it from my MSc to my PhD thesis. I am also pretty confident in communicating my research with both academia and the general audience.

Apart from playing with numbers, I love literature, guitar, and chess. Indeed, my future adventures target reading more, practicing flamenco styles, and learning the classical chess openings in deep.
