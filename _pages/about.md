I hold a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies (2021) by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. Previously, I received his BSc Degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2016), also from UPF. I joined the Wireless Networking Research Group as an intern in 2015, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Boris Bellalta. During the Ph.D., I was also a recipient of a FI grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya. My thesis research focused on developing autonomous learning techniques for improving next-generation Wi-Fi networks through efficient spectrum access.

After successfully defending my PhD with cum laude mention, I worked for 3 months in the Wi-Fi industry as a quality assurance expert, where my duties dealt with designing and executing test plans for validating the performance of customer premises equipment (CPE) devices. Then, I joined the Smartech department at Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC) as a researcher in March 2021. My work there focuses on contributing to 5G/6G-related topics like network function virtualization (NFV) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) in the context of MARSAL, a project that targets the development of novel cell-free based solutions empowered with an elastic virtual infrastructure.

I love solving complex (and simple!) problems and I do so by mixing my analytical skills and my inner curiosity to explore and approach problems in different ways. I have large experience in collecting and managing vast datasets and working with a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, and Matlab. Apart from a solid background in statistics, I am passionate about machine learning and have widely used it throughout my career. Also, I am pretty confident in communicating with specialized and general audiences.

Apart from programming and playing with numbers, I love literature, guitar, and chess. Indeed, my future adventures target reading more, practicing flamenco styles, and learning the classical chess openings in deep.
