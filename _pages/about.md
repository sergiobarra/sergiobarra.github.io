***Bridging research and real-world infrastructure in telecom, cloud, and AI systems.***

I am a Senior Researcher and Technical Lead at the Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC) in Barcelona, where I bridge advanced research with real-world infrastructure for telecommunications and AI systems. I hold a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies (UPF, 2021, *cum laude*) and have over five years of experience designing, building, and operating cutting-edge telco and datacenter environments.

Over the past three years, I have led CTTC’s laboratory operations, managing a team that has grown to over five engineers. I design labs and testbeds from the ground up, defining architectures, selecting and purchasing equipment, and deploying cloud-native, virtualized environments at scale. I have executed multi-million-euro infrastructure budgets within EU-funded (e.g., H2020) and Spanish (e.g., UNICO) projects, ensuring efficient, sustainable systems that are delivered on time, within scope, and aligned with project goals.

Technically, I specialize in multi-domain testbeds combining 5G/6G, Wi-Fi, satellite, and IP networking. I deploy and orchestrate cloud-native components using OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Docker, integrating 5G cores such as Open5GS, Free5GC, and OpenAirInterface. My DevOps and MLOps practices leverage CI/CD pipelines, GPU-accelerated AI workloads, and observability stacks built on Prometheus and Grafana. I also leverage multi-agent frameworks and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for chat-based operations, enabling the LAB team to monitor, control, and optimize complex systems through natural human language.

With over 50 peer-reviewed publications (h-index 18), I combine strong research expertise with hands-on leadership in infrastructure design and AI-driven management, turning ideas into sustainable, high-impact operational systems.

Outside work, I enjoy literature, guitar, and chess; activities that balance creativity and analytical thinking, and often inspire my approach to problem-solving.
