Komondor is an open-source simulation tool that aims to reproduce novel techniques to be included in next-generation WLANs. Particular emphasis is done to the IEEE 802.11ax amendment, and the inclusion of intelligent agents is one of the main novelties of the project.

The whole project regarding the 11ax Simulator can be found in [https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor](https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor). 

Komondor has been presented and validated in [this document](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12397.pdf).
